# Git Pull 

Similar to a [git push](./PUSH.md), a 'git pull' will interacrt with a remote repository. Only this time it will **pull** the chnages it does not have from the remote down to the local repository. 

This means any commits made that are on the remote repository will be pulled down and added to the local repository. 
'''
git pull origin main
'''
If there is any upstream connection established, you can use 'git pull' without specifying a remote or branch.
